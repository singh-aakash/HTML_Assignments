        <div style="background-color: aquamarine ">
        <ol>
            <li>In a late bowl whisk together flour/maida with semolina/sooji, sugar and salt. 
                Add baking powder, 2 pinches of baking soda and mix well.</li>
            <li>Then add oil and rub it into the flour mix with your hands.</li>
            <li> Add yogurt and mix. Then add milk, little at a time to knead the dough.</li>
            <li> Use a stand mixer to knead well for 5-6 minutes or knead for 10 minutes with 
                your hands until smooth dough is formed.</li> 
            <li> Apply little oil on top of the dough, cover it with a damp cloth and then keep 
                in a warm place for at least 1 hour.</li>
            <li>After 1 hour, divide dough into 7 to 8 equal parts, let the dough balls rest for 5 minutes.</li> 
            <li> Meanwhile heat oil in a kadai/wok on medium-high heat. Oil should be sufficiently hot, 
                if you drop a piece of dough into the oil it should come up briskly. 
                That's when the oil is ready to fry the bhatura.</li> 
            <li>Roll each dough into circle or oval shape, it should neither be too thick nor thin. 
                Add the rolled bhatura to hot oil and press gently with a ladle, until it starts to puff. 
                Fry both the sides until brown.</li>
            <li>Transfer to tissue paper to drain oil. Serve bhatura with chole!</li>
        </ol>
